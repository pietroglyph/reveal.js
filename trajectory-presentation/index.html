					<li>Show how trajectory generation and following works, not how to use it.</li>

					1. I want to show where the wpilib trajectory generator comes from, and what it improves. This is
					history+development context. Hard to glean if you don't follow wpilib+other teams.
					2. I want show how trajectory generation and following actually happen. There is good documentation
					on how to use the wpilib trajectory generator, but little documentation on how it works. I think
					that having an understanding of the internals helps with getting the best performance out of wpilib
					trajectories. This is a lso a really interesting subject!
					3. I also want to stay at a high enough level that this is easily consumed by non-experts, but I
					also want to go in-depth enough for this presentation to serve as a good reference and a jumping off
					point.

					1. FRC has had an autonomous period for a long time, and being able to drive is a cornerstone of
					effective autonomous. Usually, we want to be able to drive on a flat field.
					2. Basic autonomous has always been some combination of driving forward and turning, but you can be
					much faster if you are somehow able to drive and turn at the same time.
					3. One milestone in this type of auto was 254's (and one guy from 971's) motion planning in FRC
					presentation. This was one of the first *well noticed* presentations about more complex motion
					planning. It is also what pathfinder is based on.
					4. What they presented is mostly what made it into Pathfinder v1. (There is a pathfinder v2, but
					it's basically dead.)
					a. Pathfinder v1/their presentation covers making a trajectory that can turn and drive at the same
					time while following some constraints, but it lacks some later improvements.
					b. Later improvements like correcting for global deviations from the path, and making tuning a lot
					easier through system identification, along with more complex constraints.
					c. Pathfinder is also a lot slower in one critical way, which means that you have to pregenerate
					paths.
					5. 254 actually corrected a lot of these deficiencies in 2017, but I'm going to ignore that because
					it was different from what they did in 2018, which is the bit that made it into wpilib.
					6. Also, I know that other teams have done similar stuff even before 2015, but once again, 254's
					stuff made it into wpilib.
					7. So, they released their 2018 code which has on-the-fly generation, global controller (to correct
					for deviations), included system identification to make tuning easier, and allowed for more
					constraints on the path.
					8. In the 2019 season some teams, including my team (4915), ported and used 254's 2018 code. It
					worked great!
					9. Finally, this summer a wpilib maintainer expressed interest in porting 254 paths, and a student
					went along and did it. A lot of code was added to wpilib for this!
					10. And we're here; autonomous trajectory planning and following has never been easier or more
					robust!

					<h3>Step 1: Specify "Waypoints"</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						1. We specify a couple poses. Poses are x, y, heading.
						2. We want to get a nice, driveable path between them, like this. Then we want to follow that path.

					<h3 style="position: relative;">Step 2: Find Splines</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Can we approximate these waypoints using a convenient mathematical function?</li>
						<li class="fragment">
							Enter the Hermite Spline:
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">These are just a polynomial of some degree.</li>
								<li class="fragment">We want to find the coefficients. How?</li>
								<li class="fragment">$P(t) = H_1p_0t + H_2p_1t + H_3\dot{p}_0t + H_4\dot{p}_1t$</li>
								<li class="fragment">Every waypoint pair gets one polynomial.</li>
								<li class="fragment">We use quintic or cubic* splines.</li>
								<li class="fragment">Now we just have to sample at a bunch of different $t$s, right?</li>
							</ul>
							<small class="fragment">* Both allow for continous curvature, but cubic makes you give up control of heading at the inner waypoints.</small>
